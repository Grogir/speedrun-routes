# Pokemon Yellow Glitchless Routes

## Manip Quick Reference
- [2020 IB Route](2020-ib/README.md)
- [Gym Flex IB Route](flexgym-ib/README.md)
## What are the differences?
- Both routes are viable to get top times, and it's unclear whether one route is clearly better than the other
- The Gym Flex IB Route is the newest IB route and revolves around trying to get red bar in Silph Co, then carrying it through Koga/Erika/Sabrina
  - This route requires a lot more flexibility and has branching paths on which gyms to do in what order and when to use certain items
  - A key benefit to this route is being level 44 for Mansion, eliminating the L43 Ratatta/Raticate encounters, as well as eliminating a damage range on Champ's Magneton
  - Another benefit is the ability to do runs on both Flareon and Vaporeon Strats, while the other route can only go with Flareon
- The 2020 IB Route is the one used in the previous world record, and is simpler and more straight forward
