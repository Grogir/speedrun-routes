# Red-Blue Glitchless Routes

* [2021 Route](2021/)
* [2020 Route](2020/)

## What are the differences?
- The 2020 route uses the older WR route created in 2020 as a base, while the 2021 route has been updated to reflect the current WR route.
- Both routes are viable, but the 2020 route has an extra risk on Viridian Rival's Venusaur that has been routed out in the 2021 version.
- Because of this, it's recommended that you use the 2021 route for extra safety and slightly easier transition into non-beginner routes.
- The 2021 route has a slightly worse Agatha. In the case that you get Night Shade into Blizzard miss into Haze, you will no longer have an X Speed to use.
