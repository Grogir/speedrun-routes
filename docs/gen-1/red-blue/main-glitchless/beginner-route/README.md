## What are the differences?
- These differences revolve around fighting an extra Lass on route 3 for a much safer Moon Rocket fight and a lot of improved ranges.
- The Moon Rocket fight can be complicated to play "safely", so the Lass route makes the fight much safer and simpler.
- The Lass route has a strict requirement of using [Entr's Moon Manip](https://pastebin.com/jnj9j47S), which is slightly worse than [Route 3 Moon Manip](https://pastebin.com/tggXpQRC). However, the differences are rather minimal and both are viable, even at the top level.
