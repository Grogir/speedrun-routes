# Pokemon Red Glitchless Beginner Guide

* [Lass Version](lass/)
* [No Lass Version](nolass/)

## What are the differences?
- These differences revolve around fighting an extra Lass on route 3 for a much safer Moon Rocket fight and a lot of improved ranges.
- The Moon Rocket fight can be complicated to play "safely", so the Lass route makes the fight much safer and simpler.
- The Lass route cannot use [Route 3 Moon Manip](https://pastebin.com/tggXpQRC), which is slightly better than [Entr's Moon Manip](https://pastebin.com/jnj9j47S). However, starting out it is recommended to skip learning a full moon manip while using the Lass Route.
