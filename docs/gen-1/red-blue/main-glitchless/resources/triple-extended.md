# Pokemon Red Triple Extended Manip

**DISCLAIMER**: This is really hard, consider focusing on other execution sections if you are a beginner

How to execute it ([Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/kEtNFC8_Bjw)):
- Buffer the SAVE
  - press start while still walking on the save tile, if you stop on the tile then START Nidoran manip will work but the extend might fail
- Clear every textbox within its 4 frame window without mashing
- While doing so, remember to always have A or B held down
    - You can do this by either holding one and press the other to clear the textbox, or alternate A/B
- Beware that 'A wild Nidoran...' can be cleared withing 8 frames for the yoloball to work, but you need to hit the first 4 frames for the extend to work
- Renaming Nidoran is the only thing that doesn't have a 4-frames window
  - That's why we have multiple paths: the higher the path the later you renamed it
- Watch the NPC movements to recognize what path you hit, and execute the relative pidgey extend
  - if you are unsure who they are, click on their names in the table
- Note that Pidgey is a shorter name then NidoranM so the timing might throw you off at first
- Clear Pidgey textboxes the same way as Nidran ones
  - everyone of them is a 4-frame window
- Check NPC movement again to check if you hit the forest extend or not, and follow the forest path if you did it
  - here you might pick the one with potion or without based on your HP and the risk you want to take
- When picking up Antidote/Potion, remember to keep A held until the text stop printing
- Talk to the Bug Catcher and clear its textbox with B
- Switch to hold A when you hear Squirtle cry, and quickly do Down(or UP)+A to buffer Tail Whip
  - this is the hardest part so you will need some practice

Glossary:
  - 'r' means NPC is looking RIGHT
  - 'R' means NPC moves RIGHT
  - u->L means NPC is looking UP, then moves LEFT
  - r->D/L means NPC is looking RIGHT, then moves DOWN or LEFT
