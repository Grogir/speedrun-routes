# Gold Any% No ACE Route v2.0  by entrpntr
https://pastebin.com/KUKEC1mh original pastebin

### Intro
- Clear save data before each attempt
- No TID manip required (just find cluster that avoids FF? i use NSC's manip so ss0 is also trivial)

if you want to do rng manipulations later (they are optional), start a timer on TID hard reset and confirm minutes between 1:00.50 and 1:01.50. Also waste a step before r29 manip.

- Set the time to 10:00 AM
- name yourself A
- say Y/N/Y/Y to the Yes/No textboxes from mom

**Nickname TOTO "A " with a space at the end** reset if female

Take Totodile’s Berry off (can skip this for rival 1 safety and pick up another later)

get the egg in the pokèmon center (take 2 extra steps to not bonk)

You need 126 steps at the PC.
- Manipped no mart with ledgehop is at 32 steps at PC.
  - Count 9 up/down and you will be at 122, then do 4 extra
- Manipped with violet mart and no ledgehop is at 60 steps at PC.
  - Count 6 up/down and you will be at 120, then do 6 extra
- Non manipped: check here https://youtu.be/KzcVZZxLIP8

Save from menu. Decrement egg cycles. Clone 1 egg.

Move egg in box to top of party. Decrement egg cycles. Clone 2 eggs.

Withdraw top egg. Decrement egg cycles. Clone 3 eggs.

(REPEAT x6) Withdraw bottom egg. Decrement egg cycles. Clone 3 eggs.

Should have 16/20 in Box 1 after this, and the bottom egg in the box should be at 1 egg cycle remaining.

Attempt bad clone (deposit top 2 eggs).
Check "Change Box" after S&Q to see if clones were made. If so, check to make sure no nickname on cloned eggs. If no nickname, assume you have a real bad clone.
(NOTE: Must be in Box 1 for the move menu swaps at the very end of the run to work. If Box 1 gets filled and you switch boxes, make sure to switch back.)

Withdraw (in this order)
   - Last egg before the attempted bad clones (16th in box)
   - Bottom bad clone (last in box)
   - Top egg in box

Reference video from this point on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So_3MCF4A3k

Decrement egg cycles to hatch eggs. Nickname Togepi "A " (with a space). Don't nickname bad clone.

Party Menu
   - Select MOVE on 7th poke (cursor should already be on 7th)
   - Right 158, Left 2, (swap 1 <> 3), Right 8, (swap 1 <> 2)
   - Other cues if counting is too hard:
    - Once you see a poke with Constrict as only move, you are close (145)
    - When you get to Voltorb shortly after that poke, you are at 155
	  - Right 3 from the Voltorb (155+3=158) is Swift/Lovely Kiss/Acid Armor
	  - Left 2, swap 1 <> 3 (must load the poke with 3 moves first so you can swap moves)
	  - Right 8 (Tail Whip 0/30, Tail Whip 7/30, Tail Whip 0/30), swap 1 <> 2
   - (NOTE: Press Right as soon as you see each poke's sprite load)
